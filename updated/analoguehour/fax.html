                nvented by Giovanni Caselli,

            <h3 class="wrapper">
                The Pantelegraph is comprised of a pendulum and a stylus attached onto the receiving pendulum 
                whilst the pendulum that was transmitting the data would scan the image off of another sheet of paper with a light sensor in 
                the place of the stylus. Both pendulums at each location were required to swing simultaneously so that the electrical signal being sent across could 
                render the image without error.

            <br>

            <h3 class="wrapper">
                The Pantelegraph used a regulating clock to keep the sending and receiving mechanisms working together. 
                The biggest issue in image transmission was how to synchronize two machines in different locations.

                Financed by Leopold II, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, 
                Caselli was later introduced to Napoleon II, and later further developed with help from French Inventor Leon Foucault.

                With a successful demonstration in front of Napolean in 1860, the Pantelegraph started operation between Paris and Lyon in 1865 
                and extended to Marseille in 1867. 
                For comparison with telephone, it was not until 1876 that Alexander Graham Bell received his patent for the telephone.
